-- Cards

conceptualise a ~ card ~ C that
  is a spatio-temporal thing and
  has the value PC as ~ content ~ and
  has the value SC as ~ secondary content ~ and
  has the resource R as ~ resource ~ and
  has the spatial thing ST as ~ location ~.
Note: ~ resource ~ relates the card to some linked object by means of a standard Web URI, for example an associated image, video or audio stream.
Note: ~ content ~ the payload of this card.

conceptualise the card C
  ~ is from ~ the agent I and
  ~ is to ~ the agent A and
  ~ is in reply to ~ the card Q and
  ~ is about ~ the thing T.
Note: ~ is from ~ relates a card to its sender.
Note: ~ is to ~ relates a card to its intended recipient(s).
Note: ~ is in reply to ~ relates a card to a previously sent card.

conceptualise a ~ CE card ~ C that
  is a card.
Note: A card that contains Controlled English (CE) content.

conceptualise a ~ gist card ~ C that
  is a card.
Note: A card that contains template-based CE content, so named because they are intended to provide the "gist" of CE sentences.
Note: ~ content ~ the payload (gist content) of this card.

conceptualise a ~ gist-confirm card ~ C that
  is a gist card and
  is a confirm card.

conceptualise an ~ NL card ~ C that
  is a card.
Note: A card that contains Natural Language (NL) content.
NL cards are not classified into "ask" and "tell" variants because their content is ambiguous. Without confirmation, it is not
possible to determine for certain whether they represent a query or statement. Once the corresponding CE content is confirmed
(via a confirm CE card) an ask or tell CE card is issued.
Note: ~ content ~ the payload (NL content) of this card.

conceptualise an ~ ask card ~ C that is a CE card.
Note: Used to communicate a CE query.

conceptualise a ~ confirm card ~ C that is a CE card.
Note: Contains CE content derived from the content of a preceeding NL card (allowing a human user to confirm that their NL
content has been correctly processed into CE).
The confirm card is interesting: one could argue it's a card that implicitly contains another card. That is, if I issue the
NL card containing "there is a person named John" the response should actually be: confirm: (tell: "there is a person named
p1234 that is known as John"). Note the difference: the response is actually saying "Did you mean you're TELLing me there's
a person named John?". However, in this case I'm relying on the software mediating the conversation on the (presumably human)
agent's side to add the ASK or TELL depending on whether the confirmed CE is a query or set of facts. I think this is reasonable
because (a) it's entirely deterministic whether the content is a query or set of facts, (b) the software needs to parse the
expression anyway so there's no overhead in it it doing this classification, and (c) it avoids introducing a special case of
"meta-cards" that contain cards, and thus keeps the framework simpler.

conceptualise a ~ expand card ~ C that is a CE card.
Note: Used to request the formal CE form of the content of a preceeding "ask" or "tell" card.
Explain cards mark a transition from gist content to full CE; I envisage the content of an expand card being able
to specify CE entities that the sender wishes the expansion to focus on.
Example: gist: "the red SUV is a threat" -> expand: "red SUV" -> tell: "there is a vehicle named v12345 that has ‘red SUV’ as
description and has XYZ456 as registration and..." (here, the user doesn't want an expansion of 'threat', just the details of
the SUV).

conceptualise a ~ tell card ~ C that is a CE card.
Note: Used to communicate CE statements (but not queries).

conceptualise a ~ why card ~ C that is a CE card.
Note: Used to request an explanation (in the form of CE rationale) for the content of a preceeding "ask" or "tell" card.
Why cards mark a transition from CE facts to CE rationale; again, I envisage the content of a why card being able to specify
CE entities that the sender wishes the explanation to focus on.
Example: tell: "there is a vehicle named v12345 that is a threat and is located at central junction and..." ->
why: "v12345 is a threat" -> tell: "v12345 is owned by HVT John Smith and..." (here, the user wants an explanation of the
threat, as opposed to say, the vehicle's location).


conceptualise a ~ country ~ C.

conceptualise an ~ agent ~ A that
  has the country C as ~ affiliation ~.

conceptualise an ~ individual ~ I that is an agent.
conceptualise an ~ organisation ~ O that is an agent.

conceptualise a ~ person ~ P that is an individual.
Note: A human agent.

conceptualise a ~ service ~ S that is an individual.
Note: A software service.

conceptualise a ~ team ~ T that is an organisation.

conceptualise a ~ resource ~ R.
Note: An external resource (e.g. images or documents).

conceptualise a ~ conversation triggered event ~ CTE that
  is a CE triggered event and
  has the value FC as ~ from concept ~ and
  has the value FI as ~ from instance ~ and
  has the value MD as ~ milliseconds delay ~ and
  has the value CN as ~ check nationalities ~ and
  has the value GC as ~ generate conversation ce ~.

conceptualise a ~ conversation card triggered event ~ CC that
  is a conversation triggered event.

conceptualise a ~ conversation notify triggered event ~ CN that
  is a conversation triggered event and
  has the value IC as ~ ignore concept name ~ and
  has the value TC as ~ to concept ~ and
  has the value TI as ~ to instance ~.

conceptualise a ~ summarisable thing ~ S.

conceptualise a ~ custom summarisable thing ~ S that is a summarisable thing.
conceptualise a ~ graphical summarisable thing ~ S that is a summarisable thing.

conceptualise a ~ score ~ S that
  has the value SV as ~ score value ~ and
  has the value SE as ~ score explanation ~.

conceptualise the score S
  ~ is obtained from ~ the card C.

[ card - lat lon from location ]
if
  ( the card C has the spatial thing ST as location ) and
  ( the spatial thing ST has the value LAT as latitude ) and
  ( the spatial thing ST has the value LON as longitude )
then
  ( the card C has the value LAT as latitude ) and
  ( the card C has the value LON as longitude )
.
