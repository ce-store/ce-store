Author:  Dave Braines

Note: Everything defined in here is defined elsewhere but we cannot rely on
conversation user having loaded in those standard models, hence they are
repeated here to guarantee that they can support the conversational concepts.

conceptualise a ~ CE user ~ U that
  has at most one value S as ~ screen name ~.

there is a CE user named 'User_TestUser1' that
  has 'Test User 1' as screen name.


conceptualise a ~ spatial thing ~ S that
  has the value LAT as ~ latitude ~ and
  has the value LON as ~ longitude ~.

conceptualise a ~ temporal thing ~ T that
  has the timestamp TS as ~ timestamp ~.

conceptualise a ~ spatio-temporal thing ~ S that
  is a spatial thing and
  is a temporal thing.

conceptualise a ~ CE agent ~ A that
  has at most one value CN as ~ class name ~ and
  has at most one value D as ~ debug ~ and
  has at most one value G as ~ generate rationale ~ and
  has at most one value DR as ~ double rationale sentences ~ and
  has at most one value NC as ~ does not generate CE ~ and
  has at most one value CS as ~ send CE to store ~ and
  has at most one value CF as ~ save CE to file ~ and
  has at most one value CI as ~ save CE individually ~ and
  has at most one value RE as ~ restate existing sentences ~ and
  has at most one value FN as ~ CE filename ~ and
  has at most one value MS as ~ maximum CE sentences ~ and
  has at most one value MI as ~ maximum iterations ~ and
  has at most one value SC as ~ source concept ~ and
  has at most one value SP as ~ source property ~ and
  has at most one value SR as ~ source range ~ and
  has at most one value TC as ~ target concept ~ and
  has at most one value TP as ~ target property ~ and
  has at most one value TR as ~ target range ~ and
  has at most one value TS as ~ target source ~.

conceptualise a ~ CE triggered event ~ T that
  has at most one value NC as ~ class to notify ~ and
  has the value CN as ~ concept name ~ and
  has the value PN as ~ property name ~ and
  has the value AQ as ~ affected query name ~ and
