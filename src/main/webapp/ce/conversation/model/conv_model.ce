Author:  Dave Braines

conceptualise a ~ configuration concept ~ CC.
conceptualise an ~ uninteresting property ~ UP.
conceptualise an ~ interesting thing ~ I.

conceptualise a ~ thing ~ T that
  has the value PF as ~ plural form ~ and
  has the value PT as ~ past tense ~ and
  ~ is expressed by ~ the value V.

conceptualise an ~ attributional thing ~ A.
Note: These are things like colours, sizes, weights and measures.

conceptualise a ~ sentence ~ S.

conceptualise a ~ conversation sentence ~ S that is a sentence.

conceptualise a ~ conv thing ~ CT that
  is a configuration concept.

conceptualise a ~ conv phrase ~ P that
  is a conv thing and
  has the value PT as ~ phrase text ~ and
  has the conv sentence CS as ~ sentence ~.

conceptualise a ~ conv assertion ~ A that is a conv phrase.
conceptualise a ~ conv question ~ Q that is a conv phrase.
conceptualise a ~ conv unknown ~ U that is a conv phrase.

conceptualise a ~ conv sentence ~ S that
  is a conv thing and
  has the value ST as ~ sentence text ~ and
  has the value AT as ~ analysis text ~ and
  has the conv clause CC as ~ clause ~.

conceptualise a ~ conv clause ~ C that
  is a conv thing and
  has the value CT as ~ clause text ~ and
  has the conv word CW as ~ word ~.

conceptualise a ~ conv word ~ W that
  is a conv thing and
  has the value WT as ~ word text ~ and
  has the value WP as ~ word position ~ and
  has the conv word NW as ~ next word ~ and
  has the conv word PW as ~ previous word ~.

conceptualise a ~ processed word ~ W that is a conv word.

conceptualise the processed word W
  ~ corresponds to concept ~ the entity concept MC and
  ~ corresponds to relation ~ the relation concept MR and
  ~ corresponds to instance ~ the thing MT and
  ~ refers to concept ~ the entity concept RC and
  ~ refers in plural to concept ~ the entity concept RCP and
  ~ refers to relation ~ the relation concept RR and
  ~ refers to instance ~ the thing RI and
  ~ refers in plural to instance ~ the thing RIP and
  ~ is linked to ~ the conv extracted item EI.

conceptualise a ~ standard word ~ S that is a processed word.
conceptualise a ~ common word ~ C that is a processed word.
conceptualise a ~ question word ~ Q that is a processed word.
conceptualise a ~ possible value word ~ V that is a processed word.
conceptualise a ~ number word ~ N that is a processed word.
conceptualise an ~ unmatched word ~ U that is a processed word.

conceptualise a ~ conv extracted item ~ EI that
  is a conv thing and
  has the value IT as ~ item text ~ and
  has the matched triple MT as ~ matched triple ~ and
  has the processed word SW as ~ start word ~ and
  has the processed word OW as ~ other word ~ and
  has the processed word DW as ~ determiner word ~ and
  has the entity concept CN as ~ identified concept ~ and
  has the relation concept PN as ~ identified property ~ and
  has the thing EIN as ~ identified existing instance ~ and
  has the value NIN as ~ new instance name ~.

conceptualise a ~ matched triple ~ MT that
  is a conv thing and
  has the entity concept SC as ~ subject concept ~ and
  has the thing SI as ~ subject instance ~ and
  has the relation concept PP as ~ predicate property ~ and
  has the thing OEI as ~ object existing instance ~ and
  has the value ONI as ~ object new instance id ~ and
  has the value OV as ~ object value ~ and
  has the entity concept OC as ~ object concept ~ and
  has the value OD as ~ original description ~.

conceptualise the matched triple M
  ~ comes from ~ the conv extracted item CF.

conceptualise a ~ matched object triple ~ MOT that is a matched triple.
conceptualise a ~ matched datatype triple ~ MDT that is a matched triple.
conceptualise a ~ direct matched triple ~ DMT that is a matched triple.
conceptualise a ~ domain-matched triple ~ DMT that is a matched triple.
