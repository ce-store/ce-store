conceptualise a ~ temporal property ~ TP.

conceptualise a ~ timestamp ~ T.

conceptualise a ~ temporal thing ~ T that
  has at most one timestamp TST as ~ timestamp ~ and
  has at most one value TSV as ~ timestamp ~ and
  has at most one value DS as ~ date string ~ and
  has at most one value Y as ~ year ~ and
  has at most one value M as ~ month ~ and
  has at most one value D as ~ day ~ and
  has at most one value H as ~ hour ~ and
  has at most one value M as ~ minute ~ and
  has at most one value S as ~ second ~ and
  has at most one value MS as ~ millisecond ~.

conceptualise a ~ spatio-temporal thing ~ S that
  is a spatial thing and
  is a temporal thing.
Note: This requires the spatial thing concept from the spatial model.
  
conceptualise a ~ directed spatio-temporal thing ~ S that
  is a directed spatial thing and
  is a temporal thing.
Note: This requires the spatial thing concept from the spatial model.
