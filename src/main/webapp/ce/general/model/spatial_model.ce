conceptualise a ~ spatial thing ~ S that
  has the value LAT as ~ latitude ~ and
  has the value LON as ~ longitude ~ and
  has the value ZF as ~ zoom factor ~ and
  has the value M as ~ mgrs raw ~ and
  has at most one value G as ~ mgrs grid ~ and
  has at most one value SQ as ~ mgrs square ~ and
  has at most one value ME as ~ mgrs easting ~ and
  has at most one value MN as ~ mgrs northing ~ and
  has at most one value MP as ~ mgrs precision ~ and
  has at most one value O as ~ os reference ~ and 
  has at most one value E as ~ easting ~ and 
  has at most one value N as ~ northing ~ and
  has at most one value AL as ~ altitude ~ and
  has at most one value AZ as ~ azimuth ~ and
  has at most one value E as ~ elevation ~.

conceptualise a ~ directed spatial thing ~ D that
  has at most one value BN as ~ bearing name ~ and
  has at most one value BA as ~ bearing angle ~ and
  has at most one value V as ~ velocity ~ and
  is a spatial thing.

conceptualise a ~ place ~ P that 
  is a spatial thing and
  has the value C as ~ coordinates ~ and
  ~ is located near ~ the place P2 and 
  ~ is located north of ~ the place P3 and
  ~ is located south of ~ the place P4.

conceptualise
  the thing P ~ is located in ~ the place PL1.

conceptualise a ~ region ~ R that
  is a spatial thing and
  ~ is in ~ the region R2.

conceptualise a ~ country ~ C that
  is a region and
  has the value CC as ~ country code ~.

conceptualise a ~ state ~ S that
  is a region and
  has the value AB as ~ abbreviation ~.

conceptualise a ~ county ~ C that is a region.
conceptualise a ~ city ~ C that is a region.
