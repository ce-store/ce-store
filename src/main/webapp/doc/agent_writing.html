<h2>How to create a CE Agent</h2>

<p>
 Note that throughout this document I refer to the "CE environment" by which I mean
 the IBM Controlled Natural Language Processing Environment, or ICNLPE.
 <br/>
 This can be downloaded from the IBM developerWorks site for general evaluation and usage.
</p>

<h3>Pre-requisities</h3>

<p>
 You will require the following to be set up in order to follow this example and build
 your own CE Agent:
</p>

<ol>
 <li>
  Download and install the IBM Controlled Natural Language Processing Environment from the
  developerWorks site 
 </li>
 <li>
  Extract the jar file named CeStore.jar from the CeStoreWeb.war file
  <br/>
  If you have dropped the war file into Tomcat the jar file should be available in the
  expanded folder named CeStoreWeb in the Tomcat/webapps folder, in the WEB-INF/lib sub-folder.
  Alternatively you can import the war file into Eclipse and find the CeStore.jar file that way.
 </li>
 <li>
  Download and install a suitable Java development environment such as Eclipse
 </li>
 <li>
  Create a new project within the Java development environment and specify the CeStore.jar
  file as an import (or dependency) of your new project.
 </li>
</ol>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
 This document gives a detailed explanation of how to create a Controlled English (CE) Agent,
 hopefully demonstrating a good portion of the "CE4J" Java programming interface to the CE
 environment. There are many more methods and interfaces available than are demonstrated in
 this example, but hopefully you will get the basic idea from this and be able to explore out
 into using other parts of the environment.
</p>

<p>
 The current version of the CE environment is in alpha release and has little documentation or
 JavaDoc available. This will be resolved in a future release along with refinements to the API
 and available methods.
</p>

<p>
 A CE Agent is Java code that is able to run in the CE environment and which can directly
 interact (reading and writing) with the CE sentences and associated concepts and instances
 within the CE environment. For the purposes of this example we will write a simple RDF
 generation agent to convert the example person data within the medicine model into a FOAF
 RDF/XML format. The agent goes through a number of iterations (from very simple through to
 more complex) to demonstrate various features and techniques available in the CE environment.
</p>

<p>
 The example FOAF RDF/XML fragment that we wish to generate is given below, although the number
 and complexity of the "foaf:Person" element increases as the agent examples progress:
</p>

<blockquote>
 &lt;rdf:RDF<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xmlns:rdfs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&quot;<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xmlns:foaf=&quot;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&quot;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;!-- One of these per person --&gt;<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;foaf:Person&gt;<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;foaf:name&gt;Maggie&lt;/foaf:name&gt;<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;<br/>
 &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</blockquote>

<h3>v1.0 - The simplest possible CE Agent</h3>

<p>
 The first agent that we will create is the simplest possible, and demonstrates the basic steps
 to create any new agent within the CE environment.
 <br/>
 The following steps are required:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  Create a new Java class in your development environment, named "FoafGenerator", and specify
  that this class extends the class com.ibm.ets.ita.ce.store.agent.CeAgent.
 </li>
 <li>
  Make sure this new class is defined in a known package, e.g. com.ce.examples
 </li>
 <li>
  You will notice that four methods are defined for you since these are required for all
  CeAgent classes:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>getAgentName()</strong>
    <br/>
    This should return a unique name for this agent and is used for logging etc. It can be
    any string.
    <br/>
    Specify "FOAF Generator" as the string to be returned.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>getAgentVersion()</strong>
    <br/>
    This should return the version number for the agent. It can be any string.
    <br/>
    Specify "v1.0" as the string to be returned.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>executeAgentProcessing()</strong>
    <br/>
    This is where the build of the agent execution code will be located.
    <br/>
    Nothing needs to be added here yet.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>loadAgentParameters()</strong>
    <br/>
    This is where any agent specific parameters can be retrieved.
    <br/>
    Nothing needs to be added here yet.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>

<p>
 Now the following code can be added to the executeAgentProcessing() method.
</p>

<blockquote>
 String foafText = &#x201c;&#x2026;&#x201d; ;<br/>
 String targetFilename = getActionContext().getCeConfig().getTempPath() + &quot;foafv1.rdf&quot;;<br/>
 <br/>
 StaticFunctionsFile.writeToFile(getActionContext(), foafText, targetFilename);<br/>
 <br/>
 reportWarning(&quot;FOAF file generated at '&quot; + targetFilename + &quot;'&quot;);
</blockquote>

<p>
 The code here is extremely simple; it creates a string containing the FOAF text,
 creates a file name using the CE environment temporary folder, and then simply writes
 the hardcoded text to the specified file name.
 <br/>
 Save this method and export the class in a jar file and ensure the jar is accessible
 by the running CeStoreWeb application within Tomcat .
 <br/>
 The CE Agent is now ready to be run, but first we must define this agent using CE
 sentences. For simplicity these sentences will be added to existing CE files in the
 "medicine" folder within the CeResourcesWeb war file, but you can easily create a new
 folder and copy the medicine sentences across if you prefer.
 <br/>
 First the agent itself needs to be defined as a concept. This requires a new file to
 be created, so create a new file named CeResourcesWeb/ce/medicine/agents/med_agent_model.ce
 and write the CE sentence that defines this new agent:
</p>

<blockquote>
conceptualise a ~ foaf generator agent ~ A that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is a CE agent.
</blockquote>

<p>
 Save the file, and now we must edit the CE command file that loads the medicine sentences
 so that it load this newly created file. Edit the file named
 CeResourcesWeb/ce/medicine/cmd/med_load.cecmd and add a new line just before the
 "perform build store schema" line to load the new agent model file:
</p>

<blockquote>
-- Load the agent model<br/>
perform load sentences from url
'http://localhost:8080/CeResourcesWeb/ce/medicine/agents/med_agent_model.ce'.
</blockquote>

<p>
 Next we must define an instance of this new agent so that it can be run.
 Edit the file named CeResourcesWeb/ce/medicine/agents/med_agent_instances.ce and add the
 following CE sentence at the bottom of the file. If you chose a different package name in
 the earlier step when you created your java class ensure that the correct package name is
 specified in this CE:
</p>

<blockquote>
there is a foaf generator agent named 'foafgen 1' that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has 'com.ce.examples.FoafGenerator' as class name.
</blockquote>

<p>
 Save this file. You are now in a position to run your agent as you have created the agent
 concept and instance in CE and created a java class to carry out the work and made sure
 it is available to the CE environment running in Tomcat.
 <br/>
 You can run the class in one of two ways, both of which require a CE command sentence to
 run the agent:
</p>

<blockquote>
perform run the foaf generator agent named 'foafgen 1'.
</blockquote>

<p>
 This CE sentence can either be pasted into the existing CE command file which is used to
 load the medicine model (in which case it will be executed every time the medicine model
 is loaded, by clicking on the "medicine" link in the "Actions" pane in the browser interface),
 or if can be pasted into the "Add CE" text field in the browser interface in which case it
 will only be run when the "Submit CE sentence(s)" link is clicked in the browser. Use one
 of these methods to run the new agent, You should see a warning reported (at the bottom pane
 of the browser interface) saying that the FOAF has been generated, and you can check the
 temp folder for the CE environment to see the foaf.rdf file and check the contents.
</p>

<p>
 Something may not have worked, so here are some likely problems and their resolution:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <strong>Errors in parsing the CE sentences.</strong>
  <br/>
  Check that you spelled everything correctly and that the sentences have full stops at the end.
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>The sentence defining the "foafgen 1" instance was not able to be parsed.</strong>
  <br/>
  Did you remember to add the line to the CE command file to load the new medicine agent model
  file? Without the definition of the concept the fact sentence cannot be parsed.
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>The agent was not run and no errors were reported.</strong>
  <br/>
  Did you remember to add the line to the end of the CE command file to run the FOAF generator
  agent? (or if you ran it from the "Add CE" box, did you click on submit?)
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>The agent class could not be found.</strong>
  <br/>
  This error appears with a message starting "Unhandled ClassNotFoundException in
  StoreActions:runAgent()".
  <br/>
  Check that the package and class name you specified in the java code matches the package and
  class name specified in the CE that defines the "foafgen 1" instance. If they are both the same
  then this means that the java code cannot be located. Have you exported the jar file and located
  where the CeStoreWeb application can load it?
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Assuming you have got this to work we can now move on to more advanced versions of the agent that
 make more use of the CE Store capabilities.
</p>

<h3>v2.0 - templates and dynamic substitution</h3>

<p>
 In this version of the agent we will iterate through every person in the medicine model and generate
 a foaf element for them.
 <br/>
 First, lets change the getAgentVersion() string to return "v2.0".
 <br/>
 Now, lets add some new properties to the "foaf generator agent" concept in CE. Edit the
 med_agent_model.ce file and replace the existing foaf generator agent concept with the one below:
</p>

<blockquote>
conceptualise a ~ foaf generator agent ~ A that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is a CE agent and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the value RT as ~ rdf document template ~ and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the value FT as ~ foaf element template ~ and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the value FN as ~ output filename ~.
</blockquote>

Now edit the med_agent_instances.ce file and replace the existing "foafgen 1" sentence with the following:

<blockquote>
there is a foaf generator agent named 'foafgen 1' that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has 'com.ce.examples.FoafGenerator' as class name and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has '&lt;rdf:RDF<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xmlns:rdfs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&quot;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xmlns:foaf=&quot;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&quot;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;!-- One of these per person --&gt;<br/>
%FOAF%<br/>
<br/>
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;' as rdf document template and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has '   &lt;foaf:Person&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;foaf:name&gt;%NAME%&lt;/foaf:name&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;' as foaf element template and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has 'foafv2.rdf' as output filename.
</blockquote>

<p>
 Note that the contents of properties can be spread across multiple lines, and that any internal quote
 characters (single or double) or backslash characters must be escaped using a preceding backslash
 character if they are the same as the quote character used in CE to delimit the value (usually a
 single quote).
 <br/>
 Now that the CE has been extended to define these three properties and their values we can alter the
 Java code to take advantage of these.
 <br/>
 In your existing java class add some code to the loadAgentParameters() method to take the values of
 each of the three new properties and store them in class instance variables (as Strings), e.g.
</p>

<blockquote>
this.rdfDocTemplate = getConfigSingleValueNamed(&quot;rdf document template&quot;);<br/>
this.foafElemTemplate = getConfigSingleValueNamed(&quot;foaf element template&quot;);<br/>
this.outputFilename = getConfigSingleValueNamed(&quot;output filename&quot;);
</blockquote>

<p>
 These three string values are then available in your executeAgentProcessing() method which can be
 changed to the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
String targetFilename = getActionContext().getCeConfig().getTempPath() +<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.outputFilename;<br/>
<br/>
String foafText = &quot;&quot;;<br/>
<br/>
//Iterate through all person instances, building up the foaf text<br/>
for (CeInstance thisPerson : getAllInstancesForConceptNamed(&quot;person&quot;)) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//Substitute the instance name over the %NAME% token<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;String thisFoaf = this.foafElemTemplate.replace(&quot;%NAME%&quot;, thisPerson.getInstanceName());<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foafText += thisFoaf + &quot;\n\n&quot;;<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
//Substitute the foaf list into the %FOAF% token in the rdf doc template<br/>
String rdfDoc = this.rdfDocTemplate.replace(&quot;%FOAF%&quot;, foafText);<br/>
<br/>
StaticFunctionsFile.writeToFile(getActionContext(), rdfDoc, targetFilename);<br/>
<br/>
reportWarning(&quot;FOAF file generated at '&quot; + targetFilename + &quot;'&quot;);
</blockquote>

<p>
 This is fairly simple code that makes use of the two properties that contain the RDF and FOAF
 templates, and simply iterates through every instance of person and generates a foaf element
 with the person instance name accordingly.
 <br/>
 Ensure that the CE changes are saved, and export the updated Java code and run the agent to see
 the updated result.
 <br/>
 Note – there are a number of parent properties that you can use on CE Agent.  One of these is
 "source concept".  If you edit your CE sentence that defines the "foafgen 1" instance you can
 add a clause that says:

<blockquote>
 has 'person' as source concept.
</blockquote>

<p>
 You can then use the following line to iterate across all instances of the source concept instead
 of the hardcoded ‘person’ in the earlier example:
</p>

<blockquote>
for (CeInstance thisPerson :<br/>getAllInstancesForConceptNamed(getSourceConceptName())) {<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>
 another simplified alternative is:
</p>

<blockquote>
for (CeInstance thisPerson :<br/>getAllInstancesForConcept(getSourceConcept())) {<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>
 and an even more simplified alternative is:
</p>

<blockquote>
for (CeInstance thisPerson : getAllInstancesForSourceConcept()) {<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>
 All of the above alternatives give exactly the same results, but are increasingly more
 convenient.
 <br/>
 In the next example we will start to navigate the CE model and populate some social
 relationships into the foaf.
</p>


<h3>v3.0 - navigating relationships and properties</h3>

<p>
 In this version of the agent we will use some of the properties and relationships defined
 within the medicine example data to generate a slightly richer foaf output.
 <br/>
 For the purposes of this example we are going to pretend that the "social security number"
 CE property is the "mbox" foaf property (used to uniquely identify a foaf instance), and
 that the "age" CE property is the "phone" foaf property. Further more the CE "is closely
 related to" property will be mapped to the foaf "knows" property.
 <br/>
 In order to capture these extra properties we need to edit the template, so lets edit the
 CE sentence that defines "foafgen 1".
</p>

<blockquote>
there is a foaf generator agent named 'foafgen 1' that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has 'com.ce.examples.FoafGenerator' as class name and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has '&lt;rdf:RDF<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xmlns:rdfs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&quot;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xmlns:foaf=&quot;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&quot;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;!-- One of these per person --&gt;<br/>
%FOAF%<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;' as rdf document template and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has '   &lt;foaf:Person rdf:ID=&quot;%ID%&quot;&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;foaf:name&gt;%NAME%&lt;/foaf:name&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;foaf:mbox rdf:resource=&quot;%MBOX%&quot;/&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;foaf:phone&gt;%PHONE%&lt;/foaf:phone&gt;<br/>
%KNOWS%<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;' as foaf element template and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has '      &lt;foaf:knows rdf:resource=&quot;#%ID%&quot;/&gt;' as knows element template and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has 'foafv3.rdf' as output filename and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has 'person' as source concept.
</blockquote>

<p>
 The CE sentence that defines the "foaf generator agent" concept must also be edited to add
 the new "knows element template" property.
</p>

<blockquote>
...<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the value KT as ~ knows element template ~<br/>
...
</blockquote>

<p>
 The java code can be updated to get the new "knows element template" property, at which
 point we can focus on how the four new properties (%MBOX%, %PHONE%, %ID%, %KNOWS%) can
 be programmatically populated.
 <br/>
 The code to retrieve %MBOX% and %PHONE% is the same, but with a different property, so
 the following lines can be added inside the loop:
</p>

<blockquote>
thisFoaf = thisFoaf.replace(&quot;%MBOX%&quot;, thisPerson.getSingleValueFromPropertyNamed(&quot;social security number&quot;));<br/>
thisFoaf = thisFoaf.replace(&quot;%PHONE%&quot;, thisPerson.getSingleValueFromPropertyNamed(&quot;age&quot;));
</blockquote>

<p>
 For the %ID% property we will just use the instance name (since that is unique with
 the CE environment anyway), so we can use this line:
</p>

<blockquote>
thisFoaf = thisFoaf.replace(&quot;%ID%&quot;, thisPerson.getInstanceName());
</blockquote>

<p>
 There is a function within the CE environment to generate a new unique ID for the
 current instantiation of the environment. An example is shown below, but since the
 linkage between the person instance and the generated unique id is not persisted in
 the CE environment (because we have not written any code to do so) this is not used
 for this very simple agent example, but the code example is included as a useful
 reference. Note that the single String parameter is an optional prefix that will be
 prepended to the generated id if specified.
</p>

<blockquote>
//thisFoaf = thisFoaf.replace(&quot;%ID%&quot;, getNextUid(&quot;&quot;));
</blockquote>

<p>
 Finally we need to generate the %KNOWS% values.  There may be 0, 1 or many of these,
 so lets write a separate method to do this:
</p>

<blockquote>
thisFoaf = thisFoaf.replace(&quot;%KNOWS%&quot;, generateKnowsFor(thisPerson));
</blockquote>

<p>
 The method itself gets all unique values for the "is closely related to" property
 and generates the knows fragment for those:
</p>

<blockquote>
private String generateKnowsFor(CeInstance pPerson) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;String result = &quot;&quot;;<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;CePropertyInstance thisPi = pPerson.getPropertyInstanceNamed(<br/>&quot;is closely related to&quot;);<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for (String thisVal : thisPi.getUniqueValueList()) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result += this.knowsElemTemplate.replace(&quot;%ID%&quot;, thisVal);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result += &quot;\n&quot;;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;return result;<br/>
}
</blockquote>

<p>
 This generates the more complex FOAF output but we can see that this is not a very
 scalable approach once the number of elements and nested structures starts to grow.
 In the next version we take a completely different approach to the current templated
 approach and take advantage of the CE meta-model.
</p>



<h3>v4.0 - Using the meta-model</h3>

<p>
 As an alternative to the approach outlined so far we can instead make new CE assertions
 against the existing medicine concepts and properties that define to the CE environment
 how the medicine properties can be rendered in the foaf RDF vocabulary.
 <br/>
 So, the approach for this agent is to simply state the RDF element names for certain CE
 concepts and properties in the medicine model and provide a general XML generation
 capability that will convert any CE property to RDF element name combination. Whilst this
 is much more powerful than the original template based implementation it is still not a
 fully functional CE to RDF converter, but is a good starting point.
 <br/>
 First, to explain the meta-model.  For each concept, property and relationship that is
 specified via conceptualise sentences there is a corresponding meta-model sentence that
 is generated.  For example the conceptualise sentences below:
</p>

<blockquote>
conceptualise the person P<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;~ is closely related to ~ the person P1.<br/>
<br/>
conceptualise a ~ person ~ P that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the value S as ~ social security number ~.
</blockquote>

...generate the following meta-model sentences:

<blockquote>
there is an entity concept named 'person'.<br/>
<br/>
there is a binary relation concept named 'person:is closely related to:person' that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has 'is closely related to ' as concept name and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the entity concept 'person' as domain and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the entity concept 'person' as range.<br/>
<br/>
there is an attribute concept named 'person:social security number:constant' that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has 'social security number ' as concept name and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the entity concept 'person' as domain and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the entity concept 'data constant' as range.
</blockquote>

<p>
 These meta-model sentences can be found in the source named "populateMetaModel", and
 there are more relationships generated than those shown above. These meta-model sentences
 are complteley standard CE sentences using the core meta-model concepts, and are
 automatically generated by the CE environment after conceptualise sentences are stated.
 <br/>
 To take advantage of this in our agent we can either directly extend these core concepts
 with the required RDF or foaf element names, or we can create new concepts that contain
 this information and link to the meta-model concepts in question. For this exercise we
 will do the latter, so lets create a new concept which can capture the link between a
 concept, attribute or relationship  and the corresponding RDF element name.
 <br/>
 Add these model sentences to the med_model.ce file (note that the concept "concept" is
 the parent of "entity concept", "attribute concept" and "binary relation concept" from
 the earlier examples):
</p>

<blockquote>
conceptualise a ~ concept to element linker ~ CL that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the concept C as ~ source concept ~ and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the value V as ~ rdf element name ~.
</blockquote>

<p>
 ...and these fact sentences to the med_extensions.ce file to define the relationships we need:
</p>

<blockquote>
there is a concept to element linker named 'cel_001' that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the entity concept 'person' as source concept and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has 'foaf:Person' as rdf element name.<br/>
<br/>
there is a concept to element linker named 'cel_002' that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the attribute concept 'person:social security number:constant' as source concept and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has 'foaf:mbox' as rdf element name.<br/>
<br/>
there is a concept to element linker named 'cel_003' that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the attribute concept 'person:age:constant' as source concept and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has 'foaf:phone' as rdf element name.<br/>
<br/>
there is a concept to element linker named 'cel_004' that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the binary relation concept 'person:is closely related to:person' as source concept and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has 'foaf:knows' as rdf element name.<br/>
<br/>
there is a concept to element linker named 'cel_005' that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the attribute concept 'person:name:constant' as source concept and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has 'foaf:name' as rdf element name.
</blockquote>

<p>
 Now the FOAF generator agent can be modified to take this information from the CE Store and
 generate the output using a much more generic template. At this point we might consider
 renaming the agent from foaf generator since we can generate more than just foaf now, but
 for this exercise we won’t bother.
</p>

<p>
 The key iterator in the java code now looks like this:
</p>

<p>
 This agent is not yet completed...
</p>


<h3>v5.0 – updating the CE environment from the agent</h3>

<p>
 The final evolution of the agent is to demonstrate that new CE can easily be generated
 and inserted into the CE environment. This is not a core capability for this agent since
 its primary purpose is to generate the FOAF output file, however we can use this technique
 to record which instances have been processed.  Other example agents may consume external
 data (not CE) and convert it into CE, or in some cases (like the generic rule executor agent)
 they both consume and produce CE sentences.
 <br/>
 This agent is not yet completed…
